MosesFramework for .NET
--------------------
Modifiable Scriptable Embeddable System for .NET based applications.

<img src = "http://i.imgur.com/5hiH4P1.png">

And the result is fully scriptable application. Host provides its own functions, so scripts are bound to them. The host also choses the directives to be used by MOSES. This allows a host to decide whether the script can include other files or refer to a .NET assembly.

Current Version
--------------------
Alpha 1.0


Current Features
------------------
* Seperate scripting runtimes
* Static class/instance differentiation
* Automated GC
* No variable types while scripting
* Case insensitive
* Strict variable types while using in host
* Meta Functions (new, delete, call, set, get) for classes
* Host has complete access to script
* Host can build instances, new class definitions, functions on the fly


Requirements
-------------------
* .NET framework 4.5
